# Prediction-using-Bayesian-Neural-Network
Prediction of continuous signals data and object tracking data using dynamic Bayesian neural network. Compared with other network architectures aswell.

## Software Required
1. Matlab 2016a and above
2. Matlab Neural Netowrk Toolbox

## Data used
Two types of data were used and code for them is slightly different 
* Firstly tested network on continous time series data (Wave Signals)
* Second data set was Object tracking data from a webcam


## Running Code
Run the Matlab (.m) file from the algorithm folder you wish to see. Free to change the parameters for training and testing data, change the amount of hidden activation units in a neural network depending on your system performance.

It generates Error performance files and the Network interface generates the results.
